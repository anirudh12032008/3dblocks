This is my journal of the design and building process of **20x40 mm Block**.

## 10/15/2025 2:23 PM - Created my initial block and added 2 circles  


Started my basic project! learned about rectangle and circular patterns in fusion and a bit more details about sketching tools

Made a very small block right now and added 2 circles using the rectangle patterns tool and next i'll make 2 holes inside the block! also did shelling

## 10/15/2025 2:36 PM - Added final touches  

Added the holes for bottom for other blocks to fit! and added a cool texture of wood

Kept in mind tolerances! Idk how much tolerance to keep so I kept it at 0.2 mm right now and for thickness I went with 1mm

Played a bit with the fusion 360 render tab and tried to change some lights and material

## 10/15/2025 2:57 PM - finished shipping the project  

Published it on Printables! tried posting on maker world but that requires a real life image of the model :(
created a Bom and a very short readme, sliced it on bambu studio and created a 3mf file and this needs some supports too! but overall its coming in 4.16g
